--How do we only allow the correct NFT Curator to act in that role?

--Answer
--We create a "correctCurator a xs = elem a [xs]" haskell function.  The elem built-in function searches for an element ("a") in a list ("xs") and gives a bool ("elem :: a-> [a] -> Bool").
--We can just make [xs] a manually created list of all the addresses of the curators holding the curation NFTs. 
--This would be a hacky not-quite-right short term way of doing this until we figure out how NFT detection is supposed to work on Cardano.
