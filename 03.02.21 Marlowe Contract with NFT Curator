--To look at this contract in blockly, paste the code below at: https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/simulation

--Hurdle:
--How do we only allow the correct NFT Curator to act in that role without having an individual contract for each NFT?

--Answer
--We create a "correctCurator a xs = elem a [xs]" haskell function.  The elem built-in function searches for an element ("a") in a list ("xs") and gives a bool ("elem :: a-> [a] -> Bool").
--We can just make [xs] a manually created list of all the addresses of the curators holding the curation NFTs. 
--This would be a hacky not-quite-right short term way of doing this until we figure out how NFT detection is supposed to work on Cardano.
--But, how do we keep another Curator from snagging someone else's Bounty?  Maybe we need individual contracts after all.  

--Better Answer:
--We still do the batching like this.  But, we use pattern matching with guards for each possible NFT, then let the Bounty Maker choose from 1-999
--with each number corresponding to a topical category and a particular NFT Curator.  Then, we define the Curator as the one corresponding to that choice via guards.

-------------------------------------
-- Write your code below this line --

checkCurator= :: a -> [a] -> Bool
checkCurator a xs = elem a [xs]

--xs (for now) will be a manual list of curators.  We will batch them (i.e. "you 200 hundred use this contract).
--But then how do we keep the Cuarators from snagging each other's bounties???  A code or something between Bounty Maker and Curator?
--You use guards (as discussed in note under "Better Answer") to have Bounty Maker select topical category.

correctCurator :: (a) -> IO ()
correctCurator x = 
  case checkCurator x == 
    False -> x /= Curator
    True  -> x == Curator

--okay, next I gotta get lines 27-37 above (basically the checkCurator and correctCurator functions) under the "When" case of the "contract" function below.
