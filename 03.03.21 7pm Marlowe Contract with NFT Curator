To look at this contract in blockly, paste the Marlowe code below at: https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/#/simulation

Hurdle:
How do we only allow the correct NFT Curator to act in that role without having an individual contract for each NFT?

Answer
We create a "correctCurator a xs = elem a [xs]" haskell function.  
The elem built-in function searches for an element ("a") in a list ("xs") and gives a bool ("elem :: a-> [a] -> Bool").
We can just make [xs] a manually created list of all the addresses of the curators holding the curation NFTs. 
We will batch them (i.e. "you 200 Curators use this contract).
But, Q: how do we keep another Curator from snagging someone else's Bounty? 

Answer:
We still do the batching as above.  But, we use pattern matching with guards for each possible NFT, then let the Bounty Maker choose from 1-200
with each number corresponding to a topical category and a particular NFT Curator.  Then, we define the Curator as the one corresponding to that choice via guards.
Role tokens are built into Marlowe as can be seen when you hover over "Role" in the Marlowe Playground "Simulator page at the address above.

Curator :: Party
Curator = chooseCurator

-- Q: okay, how do we get the Marlowe code to call the "chooseCurator" function above (this is to verify which Curator in the series is correct for the Bounty)?
-- A: Deleted this language: "(ChoiceId "Choose Curator" (Role "Bounty Maker"))" and replaced it with "(chooseCurator)"
--Bounds on chooseCurator in Marlowe below should be equal to the number of choices in the guards.
