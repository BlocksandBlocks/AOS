--This is going to be an attempt at a sequential version of the AOS "Voting" (now it would be "Approval") module in Marlowe.
--Each Intel Source would provide their Intel and either be approved or not approved, then the next Intel Source could try.
--This would be a simple & primitive version until we figure out how to do the consensus by voting.
--Person 1 would be the Bounty Maker; Person 2 is the Intel Source; 
--CommitCash 1 is the Bounty.
--Choice 1 where Person 2 Chooses Something is the Proposed Intel (the "something" that is chosen").
--CommitCash 2 and 3 are Curation Stakes from the Curators (i.e. Persons 3 & 4).  
--Just add more of these CommitCash blocks for more curators.
--Choice 2 is the first Curator (Person 3) voting yes or no on the Proposed Intel.
--Choice 3 is the second Curator (Person 4) voting yes or no on the Proposed Intel.
--If both (i.e. all) Curators vote yes then Pay 1 is carried out to pay 90% of the bounty to the Intel Source (Person 2).
--That would in turn spark Pay 2 and Pay 3, which would be payments to each curator of their share of the Curation Bounty.
--The Curation Bounty is 10% of the Intel Bounty so they each get 5% in this case.
--Right above Pay 2 and Pay 3 are the redemptions of the curation stakes.
--Pay 4 and Pay 5 would be the Curators (Persons 3 & 4) forfeiting their Curation Stakes to the Bounty Maker if either doesn't vote yes.
--Wait, that line above is screwed up.  Gotta fix that.
