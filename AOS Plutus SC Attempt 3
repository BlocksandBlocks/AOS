--THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO CONTRACTS BELOW

{-Intel Provider IS a voter idea 2.2.19:  what about if the Intel provider IS a VOTER!   
Intel Provider provides his intel and a vote for himself  (a [char]-> int) as his redeemerScript.  
His [char} will bet his intel and the int will be the identifier belonging to himself. 
Then the actual voters will just provide a blank char and a vote.-}

{-Condorcet voting idea 2.2.19: ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/condorcet-0.0.1/src/Condorcet.hs) may not work because it would declare a
winner out of the available choices no matter what.  Maybe the curationVoteCheck solves that?-}

{-Another idea 2.2.19:  we create an only-members-can-vote system as in https://www.ethereum.org/dao-.  
Maybe the "Liquid Democracy" type contract there can be modified to make the appointed delegate the most voted intel provider?-}

{- Yet another idea as of 1.29.19:
Another way to structure it is with two contracts. The first contract is where the bounty poster funds with a bounty DataScript
and the voters are the RedeemerScript.  They get to redeem as long as no blacklist and they actually provide X number of votes.
But, the redeemed funds don't go to the voters (maybe a % do), they go to a second contract   **NO Idea how to do this part***.   
In the second contract, the voters provide the DataScript and funds and the Intel Provider provides the Redeemerscript and 
the redemption is allowed if the votes are sufficient.-}

{- One way to structure the voting: We make the curation and blacklist vote a single DataScript, 
then just make postIntel the RedeemerScript with the bounty [char] being provided exogenous to the SC.
This is just like the latest version (as of 1.25.19) of the Simple Resource Allocation Voting Contract I created.-}

{-Another way to do this: learn how to do multiple inputs into the onchain code.-}

{- Another way to structure the voting:   Maybe the way to do this is by including the curation vote and the blacklist vote 
right in the offchain code probably inthe postIntel fuction and then make that the only redeemerscript.Even doing the above, 
might still need multiple inputs into the onchain code for the two types of votes if the only way to compare what happens in 
two different wallets is on the chain-}

-- Gotta figure out how to do % payouts on curation, blacklisting, and intel provision.
-- Gotta figure out how to do curation and blacklisting staking (like in Marlowe).
--The code below just decides if there were more votes in favor of an intel entry or against it.
{--It doesn’t actually compare # of votes if there was more than one intel entry with more for than against.-}
{-Might be able to fix the item above by figuring out how to allow each address to only vote “1” once.-}
