Army of Spies

“...but at the length truth will out.”
					William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice

Army of Spies is a decentralized public blockchain-based approach to the allocation of information resources powered by crowdsourced, bounty-based information discovery and curation mediated through novel smart contract mechanisms for highly accurate bounty response curation via cryptocurrency remuneration.

Philosophy
Our modern world, albeit drastically transformed by the internet over the last decades, is still a world of secrets and information asymmetry. Some secrets are necessary. Some are not. You don’t need to know the launch codes to the nuclear weapon arsenal of your favorite superpower. But, you do need to know if your elected officials are taking bribes from foreign corporate interests.  It’s probably not okay for you to have the gate code to Taylor Swift’s estate. But, it’s probably okay for you to know if Kit Harington is sporting a new haircut in public since that might be a clue as to whether Jon Snow is coming back.  Some secrets are necessary. But, information is a valuable resource and its efficient allocation is a net positive for the progress of a technological society. In the case of those bits of information that are not mandatory secrets, the hidden hand of the market should guide disclosure. The whistleblower should be rewarded for telling the world that the politician is corrupt, and watchdog groups will gladly raise funds to secure the disclosure of that information. Someone who sees Kit Harington with long hair on the streets of London can inform an uninterested coworker for no remuneration, or he might accept a non-insignificant reward for that information from a Game of Thrones superfan on the other side of the world.

There are also less sensational more day-to-day categories of arcane information that might be valuable but difficult, costly, or inconvenient to acquire in isolation:  you might want to know how long the line is at your favorite bar on Friday night at 10pm, but it might not be convenient to drive all the way downtown to find out.  You might want to know if there are a lot of girls at the bar, but you might know that you can’t trust the hostess on the other end of the line when you call the bar.  You might be willing to pay a small fee to know exactly what size fly professional fishing guides are using on a trout stream near your hotel, but you might be unwilling to pay for a day of guiding that would normally be the entry point for that disclosure.  

You might really need to know how much it costs to hire an experienced ethereum smart contract developer.  But, you might realize that you can’t trust the answers you get on Reddit. 

There might also be information that is only valuable to you but still inconvenient to acquire:   you might want to know if your significant other is really at the gym with his friends or at his favorite bar with his ex.   Is his car really at his buddies or is it parked at the apartment complex of that one big-titty girl he works with?

 For a small reward, any intrepid bar goer will gladly shoot you a pic or video of the line out front, the crowd inside, or your significant other in the corner with a busty blond girl.  The college student who lives a block away will gladly go see if your dude’s car is parked in front of his female coworkers apartment for a small bounty.   The trout guide can make a few quick bucks by disclosing what size of fly to use, and you can get that isolated bit of information without buying a whole day of guiding.   Someone who has verifiably paid for ethereum smart contract development recently might be willing to tell you exactly how much they were charged, and exactly what they got in return, if the reward is high enough.   

Would this level of availability of information be a tidal shift for modern society?  Yes. Is it probably inevitable given a hi def video camera/mass-communications device in every pocket?  Also yes.   In the future, there will be no more secrets.  You WON’T be able to park in front of your mistress’s house anymore.  But, you WILL be able to get verifiable insider information on how much ethereum smart contract development really costs.  We’ll all just have to adjust our behavior to conform to a world with greater transparency.  The only question is how we manage and allocate that information discovery and transparency.  Army of Spies is a project aimed squarely at efficient market based allocation of information resources via the creation of a decentralized public blockchain-based global marketplace for information transactions. Army of Spies will not facilitate any information transactions that might constitute, encourage, or aid criminal activity, political espionage, or corporate espionage. But, Army of Spies does aim to facilitate the erasure of non-mandatory information asymmetries.  

Why does Army of Spies need Crypto?
Army of Spies is a crypto-mandatory project in that erasure of information asymmetry can only be carried out via a broadly decentralized system.   This manifests itself in three broad themes.   1) Lack of centralized data storage will be vital to avoidance of death by regulation.   Parties seeking erasure of information asymmetry of any kind may easily find themselves in an adversarial relationship with state actors wielding the regulatory hammer.   Such parties ultimately live under threat of seizure and shut down of their centralized data storage and processing.    Just as cryptocurrency has only survived regulatory fatality via decentralization, so shall Army of Spies.    2) User confidence in Army of Spies will also only be possible where there is no centralized data to be discovered by adverse parties.  Private entities holding user data are regularly subpoened for such data by state actors.   Centralized user data storage is also subject to the illicit acquisition of user data through by bad actors through security exploit.   In our modern litigious society, users also face completely legal discovery of their data via litigation by other private parties.  Centralized servers are especially vulnerable to all three of these threats to user data.  These combined weaknesses of centralized data storage mean that a system for transactions in obscured information can only operate efficiently on a decentralized basis.  3) Finally, adoption of the platform also won’t occur if there is a chance the financial side of the information transaction could be reversed once the info is already conveyed.  You can’t take back info you have already delivered to someone’s brain if they cancel their payment for that info after delivery.   Immutability is king in transactions that remove information asymmetries.  

The Army of Spies User Experience
Let’s get into the gritty details of how Army of Spies will actually work from the user perspective.     

The Intel
You decide that you want to know a secret. This secret might be what size caddis fly you should use to catch brown trout on the Weber River this weekend or if your significant other is at the gym or with his ex, or the current length of the line in front of your favorite bar.  

The Intel Bounty
You will decide how much that secret is worth to you.   Say 100 units.     This amount (the “Intel Bounty”) is the sum that will go to the person providing you with the answer to your question.  Initially, the user interface for Army of Spies will be the Cardano Daedalus wallet.   This decision has the benefit that early users of Army of Spies will be very sophisticated early adopters of a very technologically innovative cryptocurrency.   Eventually, Army of Spies may migrate to a system where users will sign up for an account at the Army of Spies website (www.armyofspies.info) or within the Army of Spies dApp.    But, it is possible that the Cardano Daedalus wallet may remain as the user interface for Army of Spies if it proves sufficiently popular. That account will allow you to post an Intel Bounty for the answer to your question.   Your username will be a randomly assigned number/name for each post to preserve privacy.   You will be known as a “Bounty Maker”.

The Intel Source
Someone who just fished for a day on the Weber River last weekend (an “Intel Source”) might be googling Weber River Fishing Reports to decide where he will go fishing this weekend.  This Intel Source will see your question and Intel Bounty (if the Army of Spies forum is web based or their is a website replication of the dApp bounties or a reddit bot posting to a subreddit or etc.).   He will then sign up for an account on the website/dApp and post his answer to the question.   His answer, and your question, will always be visible to everyone.  There might also be other answers to your question provided by other Intel Sources and they will also be visible to everyone.  [Not providing an “only the Bounty Maker can see the answers” function is intentional and probably key to adoption.  New users will want to see the quality of intel being provided before committing to pay a bounty for similar intel.] 

The Curation Bounty
Other people perusing the forums (the “Curators”) will be allowed to vote on which of the answers is the best.    Only the Intel Source who posted the answer receiving the most votes (the “Winning Intel Source”) will win his share of the Intel Bounty.   The Curators will also receive a share of the Intel Bounty (the “Curation Bounty”) equal to 10% of the Intel Bounty for voting for the correct answer.   To avoid the problem of straw man curators (i.e. an Intel Source creating a second, or third, or nth account to vote for his own intel even when it is obviously not the bounty winning intel), only the curators who vote for the answer that gets the most votes (the “Winning Curators”) will receive a share of the Curation Bounty.   Not allowing multiple accounts from one IP will mitigate straw man curator effectiveness to some extent.    However, to further control sock puppet votes, each Curator will be required to stake 1% of the Intel Bounty in order to vote (the “Curation Stake”).  Curators who vote for the answer that does not get the most votes (the “Losing Curators”) will have their Curation Stake slashed.  Curation Stake slashing will involve forfeiture of the Curation Stake and transfer of such stake to a burn address [or to AOS].  This means that a dishonest curator would have to stake an amount equal to the entire Curation Bounty in order to make 10 sock puppet votes.    As long as there were an additional 11 honest Curators placing votes, the dishonest Curator would be at risk of losing his stake.    Each Winning Curator will receive a share of the Curation Bounty equal to the Curation Bounty divided by the number of Winning Curators plus a return of their Curation Stake.   In other words a Winning Curator can expect to receive a sum equal to the Intel Bounty divided by the number that is equal to the product of 10 multiplied by the number of Winning Curators.   Such Winning Curator will also see a redemption of their Curation stake (which we have already defined above as 1% of the Intel Bounty) .   Let’s go back to our example of the fishing question and the 100 unit Intel Bounty.  If there were five Winning Curators, the sum due to each Curator would be 10 units/ 10*5 Curators = 0.2 units reward per Winning Curator plus .1 units (which is the return of their Curation Stake).   

Curation and Intel Provision Rankings
In order to further incentivise honest curation, the AOS platform will also display the number of times any given Curator has been a Winning Curator along with the number of time that Curator has been a Losing Curator.  Likewise, all Intel Sources will have a ranking showing how many times they have been a Winning Intel Source and the number of times they have been an Intel Source who did not get the highest number of curation votes (a “Losing Intel Source”).   

The Bounty to the Winning Intel Source
The Winning Intel Source would, of course, receive the remainder of the Intel Bounty which would be the Intel Bounty minus the Curation Bounty (i.e. 90% of the Intel Bounty).  In our fishing question example, that would be 100 units minus the 10 unit Curation Bounty = 90 units.  

Credentials/Evidence
Intel Sources may choose to bolster the strength of their answers by providing evidence of credentials that would establish the veracity of their answers.   These credentials could be proof of education (e.g.. here’s my diploma proving I’m an entymologist who knows what size flies are actually on the river), proof of expertise (e.g. here’s my Facebook account proving I’m a fishing guide who works on the Weber River every summer), or proof of experience (e.g. I’m not an expert on fishing but here’s a VLOG I did yesterday while catching a fish on the Weber River) . 

In some cases, it may be more appropriate for Intel Sources to provide direct evidence of the winning intel instead of credential based support for their answer.  For example, the Bounty Maker who wants to know if her significant other is hanging out with his ex in a certain bar would probably happily accept a photo or video furnished by an Intel Source.   The Bounty Maker who wants to know the length of the line in front of Bar X right now would probably prefer a video of the Intel Source in front of that line providing some proof of date and time as opposed to any Intel Source’s credentials as a bar line expert. 


Credential and Evidence Challenges
Curators will also be able to challenge the validity of any credentials offered by Intel Sources (e.g. that is not really your facebook account because I am that guy and I can prove it) or any evidence furnished by the Intel Source (e.g. that wasn’t the line in front of Bar X tonight...that was a previous night...here’s a video in front of Bar X from tonight with me talking about this Intel Bounty to prove it).   If a Bounty Maker is particularly concerned about the validity of credentials, a Bounty Maker may even offer an additional bounty (a “Credential Challenge Bounty”) for any curator to disprove the credentials of any Intel Source.   

Blacklisted Transactions Bounties
Army of Spies will not facilitate any information transactions that might constitute, encourage, or aid criminal activity, terrorism, human rights violations, political espionage, or corporate espionage.  To moderate these types of transactions in a decentralized system like Army of Spies, there will have to be a bounty for identification of any “Blacklisted Intel Bounty” to incentivise Curators to flag such Intel Bounties.  To avoid the strawman curator issue with such Blacklisted Intel Bounties (i.e. making a Blacklisted Intel Bounty with one account just to flag it with another account), the Curator who wins the bounty for flagging a Blacklisted Intel Bounty (a “Successful Blacklister”) will be randomly selected from the whole cohort of Curators who vote for the flagging of any particular Intel Bounty.  Such a bounty might just be equivalent to whatever the Intel Bounty was originally posted at or some part thereof (i.e. the Bounty Maker would forfeit some or all of the offered bounty with no info in return).  Flagging of Blacklisted Intel Bounties will require the normal Curation Stake of 1% of the Intel Bounty. The Curation Stake of Curators who attempt to dishonestly or inaccurately identify a Blacklisted Intel Bounty would then go to a random Curator in the cohort of honest Curators who voted against flagging.     



Under the Hood of Army of Spies

AOS will be executed as a dApp running on the Cardano blockchain.  The native currency of AOS will be ADA.   The smart contracts running the Cardano based backend of AOS will be written in Plutus.   

Overarching Smart Contracts Architecture
At its core, Army of Spies will be run via smart contracts interfacing initially with the Daedalus wallet and eventually with the Army of Spies dApp and web platform.  The initial intellectually tidy impulse would be to make every Intel Bounty its own smart contract.  However, the rigor of constant automated smart contract generation for each new Intel Bounty in a distributed computing environment probably precludes such a scenario.  The current direction is a strategy of a single smart contract with inputs for each Intel Bounty creation and outputs for all Winning Intel Sources, Winning Curators, and Successful Blacklisters.  This would create a pretty significant “involuntary bug bounty” equivalent to the value of all Intel Bounties currently offered via Army of Spies and housed in the smart contract(s) .  Initially, this risk can be mitigated by limiting the amount of any Intel Bounty to an amount of ADA equivalent to $20.   Eventually, A trusted third-party security audit of the smart contract(s) may be necessary here to instill minimum threshold confidence in the crypto community given such failures as the DAO’s recursive call vulnerability still being in very recent memory. 

Marketing Strategies
Could be marketed almost like a kind of real world Pokemon Go.  Slow drip marketing with a focus on community building on Reddit and cultivation of a reputation for building useful things first, second, and third and figuring out how to profit last.  We push the philosophy that ultra transparency in most aspects of life will foster radical candor, revolutionize the way humans interact, and make the world a better place. 

Securities Law Compliance Strategies

Securities law compliance is unlikely to be burdensome if the native currency is an existing large cap platform coin such as Cardano since we would not be executing any issuance whatsoever.   We would merely be using Cardano as a medium of trade.   We would also not be a money transmitting business of any kind.
